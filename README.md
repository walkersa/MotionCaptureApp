## 📱 PWA Features

### Offline Capability
- Complete offline functionality after first load
- Service worker caches all application assets
- IndexedDB stores all user data locally
- Smart cache management with automatic updates

### Installation
- Install as a native app on desktop and mobile
- Standalone display mode for app-like experience
- Custom app icons and splash screens
- Background sync for data when connection is restored

### Performance
- Optimized bundle splitting for fast loading
- WebAssembly ready for compute-intensive operations
- Efficient caching strategies for different resource types
- Memory-optimized video processing

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Service Worker Architecture
The application uses Workbox for sophisticated caching strategies:
- **Cache First**: Static assets and AI models
- **Network First**: API calls with offline fallback
- **Stale While Revalidate**: User content and preferences

### Data Storage
- **IndexedDB**: Primary storage for projects and sessions
- **File System Access API**: Native file operations where supported
- **Fallback Downloads**: Browser download API for unsupported browsers

### State Management
- **React Hooks**: Local component state
- **Custom Store**: Application-wide state management
- **Persistent Storage**: User preferences and session data

### Offline Detection
Enhanced connectivity monitoring:
- Native `navigator.onLine` API
- Periodic connectivity tests
- Network quality assessment
- Graceful degradation
